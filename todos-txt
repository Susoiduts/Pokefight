Create a Game schema and model in the appropriate models folder.
Create a route in your back-end (like /game/save) where you will send the result of each game (which Pokemon won against who, in how many turns and any other info you feel necessary). Youâ€™ll save this game data in your DB.
Create a route (like /game/leaderboard) where the front-end can retrieve all the previous games infos
Your React app should then have a /leaderboard route where the information of the previous games will be displayed.
